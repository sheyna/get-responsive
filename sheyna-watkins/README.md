#Responsive Design
###A Project for Code Fellows Foundations 2: UX/UI

Due to the nature of this design, doing the layout just with my own media queries rather than a grid was much easier. This is the first truly responsive design I have attempted. I want to experiment more with responsive type and pixel to em conversion. It took awhile to get the big picture of what I was trying to do with the type here but now that I see it I want to find more effective ways to design responsive type. I was reading some of Tim Browns articles about using modular scale design in responsive typography and I can't wait to try to apply those principles.

I had two problems with my site for this assignment. One is that the pictures in the background have nothing to force them lower on the page and so I had to continually reset the distance between them so the text wouldn't go lower than the footer. The other problem I had is that something is forcing the width of the page larger than 100% after the browser window becomes larger than 1024px. I could never figure out what was doing this, so I couldn't center the title at the top of the page when the window was greater than 1024px. I had to continually reset the margin-left for the title which was annoying.
